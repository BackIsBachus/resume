        "summary": "I am in 3rd year student in Computer Science in CentraleSupélec, Supélec formation (high ranked French engineering school). My involvement in the association Supélec Rézo as a regular member, then an administrator, secretary and president depicts my growing interest for computer science. Supélec Rézo allowed me to develop several skills among architecture, information systems management, development, working with professional hardware or managing voluntary teams working on long term projects. Finally, I recently came to like web development as both a back-end and a front-end developer thanks to my personal and academic projects. I am therefor searching a 6 month end-of-studies internship, outside of France, in this field starting in April 2016.",
