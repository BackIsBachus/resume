# resume
This is the public repository of my resume made with [jsonresume/resume-cli](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli) with the JSON schema.

Because you can use the CLI to generate the resume from the JSON it is the only tracked file here.
The branch [onepage](https://github.com/BackIsBachus/resume/tree/onepage) is a shorter version of my resume used to generate a 1 page PDF version.

## Help

This is as much as a help section for me than for people who might want to use this tool.

### Skill level keywords
* Beginner
* Intermediate
* Advanced
* Master

Those levels are the standard levels used in some templates to generate some additionnal formatting (like in Elegant).
