# resume
This is the public repository of my resume made with [jsonresume/resume-cli](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli) with the JSON schema.

Because you can use the CLI to generate the resume from the JSON it is the only tracked file here.

### Skill level keywords
* Beginner
* Intermediate
