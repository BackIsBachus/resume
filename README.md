# resume
This is the public repository of my resume made with [jsonresume/resume-cli](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli) with the JSON schema.

Because you can use the CLI to generate the resume from the JSON it is the only (usefull) tracked file here.

I apologize for those who can't read French since my commit messages are both in English and French.
